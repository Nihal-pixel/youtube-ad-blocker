# youtube-ad-blocker
Imagine opening a youtube video peacefully and you suddenly see a long ad, that must be so irritating. Taking this problem, i decided to create an extension which blocks youtube ads. So first I created a "manifest.json" file and then a "script.js" file. This helped me access the HTML content of the page. The youtube skip ad button is hidden for some specific amount of time and then displayed. If we click the button by code before it displays, WE CAN GET RID OF THE AD!
